PROJECT TITLE:
Agentic AI Travel Assistant - “Trip pick"
PROJECT CONTEXT:
The travel industry is rapidly evolving, with travelers expecting personalized, real-time
assistance for planning trips. Traditional travel booking sites require manual searching,
comparison, and coordination between multiple services. AI-powered conversational agents can
bridge this gap by providing a seamless, integrated experience, for suggesting destinations to
booking flights and accommodations, while remembering user preferences and providing
ongoing assistance.
PROJECT SUMMARY:
The Agentic AI Travel Assistant is an intelligent, multi-modal conversational agent that helps
users plan trips effortlessly. It integrates with flight booking APIs, hotel search engines, weather
services, and email systems to create a personalized travel itinerary. Powered by LangGraph and
multiple LLMs, it provides context-aware recommendations, automates bookings, and
communicates final travel plans to users via email while still keeping an active user feedback
loop.
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Travel planning is time-consuming and fragmented, requiring users to manually search multiple
platforms for flights, hotels, and activities, then coordinate logistics themselves. There's a need
Page 3
for a single intelligent system that understands user preferences, handles the search and booking
process, and delivers a complete, personalized itinerary with minimal effort from the user.
PROJECT GOALS:
Automate the search and booking process for flights, hotels, and activities.
Provide context-aware and personalized travel recommendations.
Maintain conversation memory for continuous, stateful interaction.
Enable human-in-the-loop control for approval before bookings are made.
Automate the delivery of complete travel plans via email.
APPLICATION AREAS:
• Personal travel planning
• Corporate/business travel assistance
• Tourism agencies & concierge services
• Group trip coordination
• Last-minute travel planning
PROJECT JUSTIFICATIONS:
